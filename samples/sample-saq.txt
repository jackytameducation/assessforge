You are working at the Centre for Health Protection and are tasked with investigating a suspected food poisoning incident. The table below summarises data from an outbreak of gastroenteritis:

Consumption of milk	Have symptoms	No symptoms	Total
Yes	10	30	40
No	50	10	60
Consumption of raw vegetables			
Yes	50	20	70
No	10	20	30

(a) What are the main exposures and outcome of interest in this study? (2 marks)
(b) What type of study design was most likely used to investigate this outbreak? (1 mark) 
(c) What is the appropriate effect measure to use when analysing the association between exposure and outcome in this study? (1 mark)
(d) Calculate (2 marks) and interpret (4 marks) the relevant ratio measures between the exposures and outcome.

Answer:(a) The main exposures are consumption of raw vegetables and milk (1 mark) and main outcome is gastroenteritis (symptoms of gastroenteritis). (1 mark)

(b) Case control study (1 mark)

(c) Odds ratio (1 mark)

(d) Calculation: OR for milk consumption (10/30):(50/10)= 0.067 (1 mark)
Interpretation: people drinking milk were 0.067 times as likely (93.3 % less likely) to develop gastroenteritis as those not drinking milk (Drinking milk might be interpreted as protective against gastroenteritis). (2 marks)

Calculation: OR for raw vegetables consumption (50/20):(10/20)= 5 (1 mark)
Interpretation: people eating raw vegetables were 5 times as likely (500% more likely) than those who did not eat raw vegetables to develop gastroenteritis (Eating raw vegetables could likely be the causative agent of gastroenteritis at the party). (2 marks)

Mrs. Chan, aged 86, was a nursing home resident who was on medication to treat her depression and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor to treat her hypertension. She felt unsteady on her feet for the past week after starting the anti-depressant medication two weeks ago and was admitted to hospital following an unwitnessed fall. Her blood pressure was normal on admission and the following data were her results:
Serum Na+ = 108 mmol/L 		(Normal = 136-148 mmol/L)
Serum K+ = 4.5 mmol/L 		(Normal = 3.6-5 mmol/L)
eGFR = 100 ml/min 			(Normal = 90-140 ml/min)
Serum osmolality = 250 mmol/kg	(Normal = 275-300 mmol/kg)
Urine osmolality 250 mOsm/kg 	(Normal <100 mOsm/kg)

(a)	What is this patient's diagnosis? (1 mark)
(b)	Based on the case scenario, explain why this patient has low serum sodium level and the underlying mechanisms for this physiological change. (4 marks)

Answer:(a)	Syndrome of inappropriate of secretion of anti-diuretic hormone / SIADH (1 mark)

(b)	SIADH leads to excessive water retention (1 mark) that dilutes the serum sodium level (1 mark); ACE inhibitor reduces aldosterone level (1 mark), hence increases the excretion of sodium in urine. (1 mark)

Saliva is produced and secreted by the salivary glands of the body. These glands are under control of the autonomic nervous system.

Describe how acetylcholine is involved in primary saliva production in the acinar cells. (5 marks)

Answer:•	Acetylcholine binds to M3 muscarinic receptor on the acinar cells (1 mark) to induce increase in intracellular calcium level (1 mark). This would stimulate Ca2+-activated chloride channels on the apical membrane (1 mark).
•	Movement of Cl- lead to paracellular transport of Na+ into the luminal side via tight junctions (1 mark), hence water into the lumen to form isotonic saliva. (1 mark)
